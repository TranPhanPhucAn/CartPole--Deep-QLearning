# Cart-Pole Balancing
To run this project, you need install some library that I write in setup.txt. 

Turn on terminal and run pip install -r setup.txt to install library.

Run python main.py in terminal to train models.

Run python test_agent.py to view the result.

I run in Windows and anaconda with Python 3.11.
